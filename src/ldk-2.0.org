* Introduction
There is no 2.0 kit released officially.  But all the
components that make up the kit (refer /[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByhNY8nO_CW3T3kyWXR1Q0NFN2s/view?usp=sharing][DPR]]/ page 11) are
achieved independently and tracked by a repository on
github.

* Auto Deployment 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: autodeployment
:END:
Release 2.0 achieves generation of a qualified domain name
after the lab is deployed on a virtual machine.  This
entails communication with a =systems= service to retrieve
the domain name.  For more details refer to the /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.2.0][release]]/
/[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.2.0][notes]]/ of the /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.2.0][OVPL 2.0]]/ /[[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/releases/tag/v1.2.0][release]]/.

* Web 2.0 Compliance
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: webcompliance
:END:
The release contains the documentation and software to
1. convert labs from UI 1.0 to UI 3.0 manually.  Once a lab
   is converted to UI 3.0, the lab becomes responsive.
2. structure a lab to comply with a standard UI template.

Sources are available in a /[[https://github.com/vlead/ui-3.0-toolkit/releases/tag/v3.0][repository]]/ on /[[https://github.com/vlead/ui-3.0-toolkit/releases/tag/v3.0][github]]/.

* Analytics 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: analytics
:END:
An /[[http://vlabs.ac.in/analytics/usage.html][analytics]]/ service is developed that exposes a set of
API to display usage and hits of Virtual Labs.

* Secutiy Framework 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: securityframework
:END:
All labs at integration levels 5 & 6 are deployed on AWS
cloud.  The cloud is designed in such a way that the virtual
machines hosting the labs are not accessible to the outside
world.  A layer of security is built on top of these VMs
such that the traffic is directed through a single machine
called =router=.

* Persistence API 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: persistence
:END:
/[[http://edx-courses.vlabs.ac.in][Ten labs]]/ are ported to Open edX /[[https://vlabs.ac.in][platform]]/.  The platform
provides persistence where the user in a new session is
moved to the same section that he/she has accessed in the
previous session.  The procedure to setup the platform and
port virtual labs to the platforms is part of a /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/blob/develop/src][repository]]/
on /[[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/blob/develop/src][github]]/.

* Performance 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: performance
:END:
Central Platform Engineering has designed the cloud to
ensure each virtual lab is hosted in a separate virtual
machine.  This ensures a high availability and performance
since all the resources of the virtual machine are dedicated
to the single lab that is hosted on the machine.

* Packaging 2,0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: packaging
:END:
Packaging labs in a USB is not pursued.  This activity is
put in abeyance due to the decisions taken at several
meetings.
